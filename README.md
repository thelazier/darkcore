Darkcore
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UdjinM6/darkcore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UdjinM6/darkcore)

A pure, powerful core for your Darkcoin project.

Darkcore is a complete, native interface to the Darkcoin network, and provides the core functionality needed to develop apps for Darkcoin.

Forked from Bitcore ([https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore)) and therefore has fully compatible API.
